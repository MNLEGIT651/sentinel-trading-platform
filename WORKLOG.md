## Active Context

_Last updated: 2026-04-10_

### Current Architecture Decisions

- **Web → Engine**: All calls go through `apps/web/src/lib/engine-fetch.ts` (same-origin proxy)
- **Web → Agents**: All calls go through `apps/web/src/lib/agents-client.ts`
- **Deployment**: Vercel (web) + Railway (engine + agents) + Supabase (database)
- **Agent coordination**: `docs/ai/state/project-state.md` is the single source of truth for task status

### Known Working Patterns

- `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build` for Node workspace validation
- `pnpm lint:engine && pnpm format:check:engine && pnpm test:engine` for Python engine
- `pnpm guardian` to run PR Guardian checks locally before creating a PR
- `turbo --ui stream` required for CI/scripting (TUI mode swallows output otherwise)
- `pnpm install` may prompt interactively — answer Y if it asks to rebuild node_modules

### Known Gotchas

- Node 24.x triggers `typescript-estree` warnings (supports <6.0.0) — cosmetic, non-blocking
- TypeScript 6.0.2 is bleeding edge — some ecosystem tools emit warnings
- `apps/web/.next/cache` can grow large — `pnpm clean` if builds are slow
- `proxy.ts` and `middleware.ts` cannot coexist in Next.js — use only `proxy.ts`

| Date       | Agent    | What Was Tried                                     | Why It Failed                                            | Lesson                                              |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-04-09 | Multiple | 8 overlapping PRs from 3 agents                    | No coordination — agents didn't check for in-flight work | Always check open PRs before starting work          |
| 2026-04-09 | Codex    | PR #297 used `BrokerInterface` class name          | Hallucinated — actual class is `BrokerAdapter`           | Run `pnpm typecheck` before creating PR             |
| 2026-04-09 | Codex    | PR #295 added `middleware.ts` alongside `proxy.ts` | Next.js rejects coexistence of middleware + proxy        | Check existing patterns before introducing new ones |
| 2026-04-09 | Codex    | PR #297 touched 64 files across 5 subsystems       | Too broad — impossible to review safely                  | Keep PRs under 20 files, one concern per PR         |

## Session Log

> Brief entry per agent session. Most recent first.

### 2026-04-13 — Codex (Markets chart 503 resilience)

**Goal**: Fix Markets chart failure mode when bars endpoint returns 503 so users still see chart context and can retry.

**What changed**:

- Updated `useBarsQuery` to parse upstream error payloads and attach status metadata to fetch errors
- Added status-aware retry policy for bars fetches (extra retries for 502/503/504)
- Updated Markets page chart panel to degrade gracefully: keep rendering chart with simulated data, show in-panel warning alert, and keep a retry action
- Added regression test covering bars 503 fallback behavior

**Validation**: `cd apps/web && CI=1 pnpm vitest run tests/pages/markets.test.tsx --reporter=dot` (pass), `pnpm lint` (pass), `pnpm test:web` (pass), `pnpm --filter @sentinel/web build` (pass).

**Decisions**: Prefer graceful degradation for chart-data outages over hard-failing the panel while preserving explicit simulated-data labeling.

### 2026-04-10 — Copilot (PR Guardian System)

**Goal**: Build automated guardrails to prevent AI agent drift and quality issues.

**What changed**:

- Created `scripts/pr-guardian.mjs` — 7-check automated PR quality gate
- Created `.github/workflows/pr-guardian.yml` — CI enforcement
- Created `.github/agents/repo-guardian.agent.md` — on-demand audit agent
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with PR quality gates and self-validation checklist
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with scope/freshness rules
- Updated `.github/pull_request_template.md` with agent metadata fields

**Validation**: lint (3/3 pass), test (1122/1122 pass), build (3/3 pass)

**Decisions**: Delta-based file health (not absolute), import checks advisory-only,
overlap/staleness fail only with high-risk paths.

**Next steps**: Add pre-PR validation script, WORKLOG, worktree management, enhanced agent-ops.

### 2026-04-09 — Copilot (PR Audit & Consolidation)

**Goal**: Audit all 8 open PRs, validate main, close stale PRs.

**What changed**: Closed all 8 open PRs (#301, #300, #298, #297, #295, #288, #287, #283).
Deleted 8 stale remote branches. Validated main at `e42c779`.

**Validation**: install, lint (3/3), test (1596 total), build (3/3) — all pass.

**Decisions**: All 8 PRs superseded by consolidated merge PR #303. No cherry-picks needed.
